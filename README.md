# STAKLOREZAC GALETIN Website 🍾✨

Welcome to the repository for the official website of **STAKLOREZAC GALETIN**. Here, we cut glass... but not corners! 😜 Our website is the pinnacle of showcasing our ability to handle glass better than our emotions. 😅

## About 🕺

STAKLOREZAC GALETIN: Where glass meets class... and sometimes a hammer! For years, we've made glass look glassier and shinier, so if you've got something to showcase or just a fragile ego, you're in the right place. 😉

## Features 🎡

- **Portfolio Showcase:** A gallery of all the times we didn't break things. Miracles do happen, folks! 🙌
  
- **Service Details:** Ever wanted to know the difference between a cut and a "whoops"? We got you! 🥸
  
- **Testimonials:** From satisfied customers and a few from our therapists too. Kidding! Or are we? 🤔
  
- **Contact Form:** If you wish to praise, inquire, or just send funny GIFs our way. 🤙

## Getting Started 🚀

Wanna dive deep into our glassy world? Let's hope you're more coordinated than we were during our first glass cutting class. Follow these steps:

1. Steal... I mean, clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CarmineMattia/Galetin.git
    ```

2. Step into our mess:

    ```bash
    cd Galetin
    ```

3. Install dependencies (might include bandaids):

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Break... I mean, run the website locally:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

If everything went well, congrats! If not, it wasn't us... the cat did it. 🐈💨

## Contributing 🤝

Have cutting-edge ideas (pun intended)? Sharpen our edges, pitch in! But remember, like a fragile piece of glass, our feelings can also get hurt. Be kind. Or funny. Preferably both. 😎
